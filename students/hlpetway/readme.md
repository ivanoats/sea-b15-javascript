# Hailey Petway

Hi my name is Hailey, and I'm a student in the next JavaScript Dev Accelerator. I live in Fremont, and have been in Seattle for the past four years. 

I'm somewhat new to JS programming and before this class I studied on my own and took Code Fellow's Foundations II JS course. I look forward to meeting everyone and digging into the programming nitty gritty with you in the next few months.
