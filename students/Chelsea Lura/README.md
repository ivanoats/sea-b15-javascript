+ ####An 'about me' & why I enrolled in Code Fellows-Development Accelerator:####
    I have always had a passion for taking a seemingly incomprehensible or foreign material and slowly hacking away at it's parts and kinks in order to creatively use it. I received my Bachelors from University of Washington, about two years ago, with a major in Japanese language/linguistics and a minor in Technical-business Japanese. Unfortunately, I haven't found much fulfilling work at my current skill-set.

    Therefore, I decided to take a leap of faith and try applying my natural above stated passions towards web development. I am ecstatic about giving it my full attention and focus!

+ ####Interests (Outside of programming):####
    - Cooking
	- Playing video games
	- Watching media on my Roku
	- Espresso connoisseur
